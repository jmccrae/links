==============
These links point out the new semantic representations of nyt resources. To resolve these URIs you have to [apply for an api-key](https://developer.nytimes.com/signup) fot the nyt api. With this key append the URIs with ```?api-key=youApiKey&fields=all```.

Do you have a better description for this linkset? Can you contribute better links?
Then have a look at the [how-to wiki page](https://github.com/dbpedia/links/wiki/How-To-Contribute-Links-to-DBpedia)  

More information about the links might be found [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/semantic_api.json#/README)
